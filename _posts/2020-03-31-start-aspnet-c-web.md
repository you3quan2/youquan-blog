## Learning Outcomes
In this tutorial, we will:
- Learn how to to setup a one-page ASP.NET web application with Visual Studio.
- Familiarise with the components in Visual Studio, including **Solution Explorer**, **Toolbox**, **Properties** and **Project View**.

## Why we need to learn this?
I believe you are here because you want to learn ASP.NET Web Programming, and Microsoft Visual Studio is the tool which you must learn how to use as it is the defacto IDE for ASP.NET. My experience tells me that it is always better to start by having a brief tour on the tool which we are going to use in developing a project. It is going to save a huge amount of time throughout our learning process later on. We can save the questions like: *Where is my toolbox?*, *Where is my button's properties?* etc.

## Requirements
Microsoft Visual Studio (I am using the 2019 version). See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2019) on how to download and install.

## Create the Project
1. Open our Visual Studio IDE and click on:

  Alternatively, click on **FILE** and **New Project**.

1. Choose the ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework). Make sure it is the C# template.
